TASK 4: FOR LOOPS

In this task you'll learn about for loops and how they can be used to iterate
through all items in a list.

If you want to print all the items in a list, you can do it the same way we
did in task 3 for all items. However, this can be quite time-consuming and end
up with a lot of code if there are many items in the list.

To print all the items in the list in an easier way, we can use for loops. When
using for loops, it goes through each item in a list one by one and does
whatever you want with the values (for example printing them). Here's an example:

    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    for number in numbers:
        print(number)

The code above will print the following result:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

even_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

"""
--- TASK 4A ---

Use a for loop to print all the items in the list "even_numbers".
"""

# Write your code here

"""
--- TASK 4B ---

Use a for loop to print all items in the list "even_numbers", but this time you
should add 1 to each value. In other words, print the value + 1 for each item in
the list.

# Write your code here

"""
--- TASK 4C ---

Create a new list with five vegetables and print all the items using a for loop.
"""

# Write your code here

prices = [10, 20, 12, 32, 44]
new_prices = []

"""
--- TASK 4D ---

We want to increase all prices in our webshop with 10 NOK. Use a for loop to go
through the list of prices. For each item in the list, add the value + 10 to the 
list "new_prices". Finally, print the "new_prices" list to see the result.

(Hint: take a look at task 3 if you can't remember how to add items to a list.)
