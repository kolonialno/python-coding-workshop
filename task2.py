TASK 2: INPUT FROM A USER

In this task you will learn how to use input from a user. Run the code below
and see what happens.
"""

x = input("Write your input here: ")
print(x)

"""
--- TASK 2A ---

Create a new variable called "name". (Hint: in the code snippet above we 
named the variable "x").

The variable should be assigned a value based on input from a user. Ask the 
user for it's name, and assign the value to the "name" variable.

Finally, print the name to check that the name has the value you expect.
"""

# Write your code here

"""
--- TASK 2B ---

We now want to make an if statement to check whether the name of the user
is "Oda". If that's the case, we want the terminal to print "That's a cool
name!". To compare values, we use two equals, for example x == 10.

Remove the three " above and below the code snippet below and add the
variable and value needed.
"""

""""
if .. == ..:
  print("That's a cool name!")
"""

"""
--- TASK 2C ---

Add an elif statement to the code snippet above that prints "Did you know
that Ada Lovelace was the first programmer the world?" if the name is "Ada".

(Hint: take a look at task 1 to see how an elif statement can be written.)
"""

"""
--- TASK 2D ---

Add an else statement to the code snippet above that prints a text of your
choosing if neither the if or elif checks kick in.
