TASK 1: VARIABLES AND IF STATEMENTS

First, we define two variables called x and y. If you want, you can change
the values to something else, for example by replacing 10 with another number.
"""

x = 10
y = 20

"""
--- TASK 1A ---

Let's check that the values we chose above are assigned to the variables. We use
the print method to check this, and the values will appear in the terminal (the
black window to the right).

Remove the # in front of print(x) and press "Run" (alternatively Ctrl+Enter on
Windows or Cmd+Enter on Mac). 
"""

#print(x)

"""
--- TASK 1B ---

We can also add more text to the print method to make the output easier to read.
Again, remove the # and press "Run".
"""

#print("x has the following value:", x)

"""
--- TASK 1C ---

Write code to check that y has the value you expect. Press "Run" and verify 
that the value is correct.
"""

# Write your code here

"""
--- TASK 1D ---

Ask the colleague next to you about her/his age. Assign your age and the age of
the colleague next to you to separate variables.
"""

#my_age =
#colleague_age =

"""
--- TASK 1E ---

You are now about to create your first if statement! We want to check who's the
eldest â€“ you or your colleague?

First, have a look at the code below. What do you think will happen when this
code is run?

When you're done thinking, remove the three " above and below the code and run it.
"""

"""
if my_age > colleague_age:
  print("You are the eldest!")
elif colleague_age > my_age:
  print("Your colleage is the eldest!")
else:
  print("You are the same age.")
"""

a = 5
b = 3

"""
--- TASK 1F ---

Make an if statement where you check whether a or b has the largest value.
