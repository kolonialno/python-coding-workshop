TASK 5: FOR-LOOPS AND IF-SENTENCES

In this task you will learn to combine what you have learned about if-sentences and for-loops. 

You can loop through all elements in a list and do something if a element satisfy the if-sentence. 

For example, you can loop through a list of numbers and print the number if it is bigger than 10:

numbers = [12,1,3,15,20,4]

for number in numbers:
  if number > 10:
    print(number)

This code would give the result below:
12
15
20

"""

prices = [20,31,50,17,37]

# A: Print all prices that are lower than 35kr.

# B: Loop though the list of prices. If the price is lower than 35kr, print "Cheap", if not print "expensive". Hint: Have a look at task 1

names = ["Mari", "Espen", "Sandra", "Oda", "Per"]

# C: Loop though the list of names. Print all names except "Oda". Hint: To check if something is not equal something else you can use !=


# ------------------ Optional tasks --------------------------


numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# D: Loop though the list of numbers. Print all numbers that can be divided by 2. Hint: You can check if something can be divided by to like this: number%2==0

numbers2 = []

# E: Loop though the list "numbers". Append the number to numbers2 if the number can be divided by 3. Print numbers2 afterwards.
