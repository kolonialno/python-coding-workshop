TASK 3: LISTS

In this task you'll learn about lists. You'll learn how to print a specific
item in a list and how to add an item to a list.

First, some background information about lists: instead of assigning one
value to a variable, we can assign a list of values. Here's an example
where we have a list called "my_list":

    my_list = ["item0", "item1", item2"]

Everything between the square brackets ([]) is part of the list, and the items
in the list are separated with commas.

To retrieve one specific item in a list you have to specify which position the
item has in the list. The positional value starts with zero in Python, which
means that the first item is in position 0, the second item is in position 1
etc. You can print the first item in a list like this:

    print(my_list[0])

To add a new item to a list, you can use a method called append:

    my_list.append("My new item")

After this method is called, the list will look like this:

    my_list = ["item0", "item1", item2", "My new item"]
